Prompt:

Build a creative developer portfolio website for Vikas Singh Rajput, using React + TailwindCSS with a mixed aesthetic of pixel art and doodle illustrations. The layout should be interactive, fun, and responsive — like navigating a digital sketchbook + retro RPG screen.

🎨 Style Guide:
Use pixelated UI components (borders, sprites, 8-bit fonts) and hand-drawn doodles (squiggles, arrows, frames).

Fonts: "Press Start 2P" for headings, Inter or hand-drawn for body.

Use animated elements from Framer Motion.

Color scheme: Retro console (grays, neons) with off-white sketchbook tones.

🧱 Page Structure:
🧍 Hero Section

Tagline: "AI-Powered Full Stack Dev | Building Inclusive Technology"
